Hello there! 

My name is Andrew Dang. While completing my Master of Science in Biomechanics, I fell in love with data processing and data analysis. Upon graduation, I enrolled in a Data Science Diploma program at BrainStation. Previously I have worked at Forma.ai as an Analytics Engineer where I developed and maintained data pipelines that powered our SaaS platform. I also have experience working as a Business Intelligence Engineer at Badal where my focus was on building dashboards that monitored our cloud spending. 

I enjoy integrating my technical skills with my hobbies. I built a dashboard that collects online tournament results for the Pokemon Trading Card Game to keep track of the performance of different deck archetypes. I believe in using data to gain a competitive advantage and I strive to help others make data driven decisions.
