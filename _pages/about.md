Hello there! 

My name is Andrew Dang. I love creating and automating data pipelines. What excites me the most is the process of figuring out what transformations need to be applied to the raw data to map it to a form that enables stakeholders to answer their specific business questions. Every new data source is a new puzzle, and I love nothing more than a challenging problem. Previously, I have worked at Forma.ai as an Analytics Engineer where I developed and maintained data pipelines that powered our SaaS platform. I also have experience working as a Business Intelligence Engineer at Badal where I built dashboards that monitored our cloud spending. 

Outside of working with data, I enjoy hiking with my dog Louie, who ensures there is never a dull moment.
